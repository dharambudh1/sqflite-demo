# SQFLite Demo

## Description:
This is a demonstration of the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality implemented with SQFLite.

The initial screen of this sample application displays a list of entries, allowing users to view existing data entries. Each entry is accompanied by two buttons for performing actions like updating and deleting the entry.

The second screen serves a dual purpose, enabling users to either create a new entry or update an existing one. If a user navigates to this screen by clicking an “+” button, they can create a new data entry by completing the provided form. In this scenario, a new data entry is generated. Alternatively, if a user accesses this screen by selecting an edit icon for a data entry, they can update the data entry by editing the provided form. In this case, a new data entry is not generated.

Should a data entry exist, and the user chooses to delete it by clicking the delete icon, it will be permanently removed from the list. There is no recovery option within this sample application.
